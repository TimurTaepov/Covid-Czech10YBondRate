!Project for study purposes!
Analysis and comparison of statistics on Covid in the Czech Republic and the Price for a 10-year state bond of the Czech Republic
Random number generator for uniform distribution on [0,1]
A random number generator for a distribution law given by a continuous function (normal, exponential, gamma, Student's t,â€¦.).
Random number generator for discrete distribution with a finite number of values
(distribution Bernoulli, binomial, ...)
Random number generator for discrete distribution with countable number of values
(Poisson, geometric)
Calculation of basic sample characteristics. Demonstration of their asymptotic stability: convergence to the characteristics of the general population.
- sample distribution function, event frequency, function
- initial and central moments
- sample mean, variance, mode, median
- asymmetry, kurtosis
- quantiles, quartiles, deciles and their sample analogs (ordinal statistics)
Astotic normality of the main sample characteristics. Plotting a series of histograms
Behavior of the main sample characteristics in a normal general population.
Point estimates. Unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency.
Construction of confidence intervals
